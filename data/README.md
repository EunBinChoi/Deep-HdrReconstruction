# Data

This folder contains some input LDR images (.png) and the corresponding ground truth HDR images for quickly evaluating our approach.

For some images, we do not provide the ground truth images here, due to license constraints. Instead, we provide below the links for directly downloading from them the source website. However, we have not provided the ground truth for some input images. We captured these images using a DSLR camera Canon Mark IV and have not created the corresponding HDR ground truth.
